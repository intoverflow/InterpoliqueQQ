This is an implementation of Dan Kaminsky's "Interpolique" as a Haskell
quasi-quoter.  See Test.hs for examples.

Also shown here: the Taint monad, which shows how we can use rank-2 types and
monads to track the progression of tainted data, and even use this to prevent
tainted data from escaping a given context before it has been scrubbed.  See
TestTaint.hs for examples.
